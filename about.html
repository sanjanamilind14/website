                <h2>MY STORY</h2>
                <p>
                    Hola!! I 'm <b>YASH SINGH</b>, a self-taught artist. I have been honing my craft since my school days.
                    With a passion for art passed down from my father, Randhir Singh Thapa  began my artistic journey by
                    creating a portrait of myself and a friend. This early piece was the spark that ignited my love for
                    creating and set me on the path to becoming the talented artist.
                    <br>
                    Inspired by my father's artistry, I began experimenting with different mediums and techniques,
                    teaching myself the skills I needed to bring my own visions to life. My work is heavily influenced
                    by the world around me , and I have a particular talent for capturing the essence of my subjects in
                    a way that is both honest and evocative.
                    <br>
                    As my skills grew, so did the demand for my work. I began receiving commissioned pieces, and my
                    reputation as a talented artist quickly spread. Today, I am well-known for my ability to create
                    portraits that are both lifelike and expressive. I am also adept at creating landscapes and still
                    life pieces that are both beautiful and thought-provoking.
                    <br>
                    While I am self-taught, I am always looking for ways to improve and expand my artistic horizons. I
                    am constantly experimenting with new techniques and mediums, and my work continues to evolve and
                    grow.
                    <br>
                    To see more of my work, you can find me on my instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_artspoon_/?next=%2F">_artspoon_</a>.I am available for commissions and
                    collaborations, and is always open to new challenges and opportunities to showcase my talent and
                    passion.
